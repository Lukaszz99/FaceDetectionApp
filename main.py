    # encodings = .pickle file with known coded faces for recognition, you can make your own .pickle file
    # min_time - minimum amount of time a person must be recognized to gain access
    # src - camera video source, 0 is for hardware build-in camera.
    # You can pass IP address, checkOpenCV VideoCapture manual for more
    # detect_method - given in arguments, hog or cnn
    # scale - frame scaling for face recognition, use 1.0 if you have powerful CPU
    # or 0.5 for more FPS. Lower scale lowers recognition accuracy
